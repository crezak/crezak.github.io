                <p>Hakim : Me and my friends are going to travel halfway around the world and we
wanted to share this unforgettable experience with you. So we had to pack our bags
and go to the airport of charle de gaulle , our flight was at 10 o'clock we had to leave
our home around 6 o'clock in the morning. Arrived at the Airport, we had breakfast.
I’m sure you’d like to know where we’re going, it’s a surprise. I hate masks, I hate
coronavirus.

                <p>Hakim : Once on the plane I fell asleep , Nabil and Abdel watched a movie while
Slimane listened to music . Once arrived at the Chicago Airport around 8 am , (yes
we went to the United States). The time difference made us weird , so we took a
hotel for a rest , the rooms were really beautiful we had a view of the whole city
center but also on the Chicago river , the hotel was called River Hotel

                <p>Nabil: When we got to Colorado, we all stopped in 20 hours on the way to a motel for
a rest, and then we hit the road again. We arrived in Colorado around 6:00 in the
morning because we were out at 8:00 in the morning from Chicago we went to the
Austria Haus Hotel it was beautiful there was an incredible service, there was a gym,
a swimming pool, everything we wanted, we stayed 5 days. Then we visited places
like the Denver Botanic Gardens, which looked like Paradise, and we really felt the
smell of nature. Then we went back to Las Vegas, we took Route 70 and then Route
15 in all we had to take 16 hours to get there because we stopped several times to
get gas.

Slimane: Arrived in Las Vegas at 9 pm , we went to eat Pasta Mia West which
spanked very good pasta in addition Nabil who is Italian validated pasta
Then we went to the Bellagio Hotel-Casino and settled down and went to play at the
casino. Abdel came out with empty pockets , he put 3,000 dollars on the red , and it
fell on the black , Abdel was sweating. Me, Nabil and Hakim each made about
$20,000. We went to a club while Abdel went to sleep. We took a girl’s number for
Abdel. We stayed 3 days in Las Vegas , the next day we went to an amusement park
called The Adventuredome , We did the big Eight we all threw up , it was really Funny
after we packed up our things then we took the road back to Los Angeles again.
